                <h3>My Journey In Counselling Practice</h3>
                <p>
                    I am an integrative counsellor who is person-centred at my roots but can use other approaches such
                    as CBT and trauma techniques in my therapy.
                </p>
                <p> I am dedicated to helping individuals navigate their journey through life, addressing challenges
                    such as stress, anxiety, depression, low mood, relationship issues, and bereavement.
                </p>
                <p> I provide a safe, welcoming, and healing environment where clients can explore their concerns
                    without fear of judgment or opinions. my style of counselling encourages you to lead the process,
                    going at a pace that is unique to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a background in healthcare and lived experience with mental health challenges, I bring a deep
                    understanding and empathy to my work. I have supported clients facing a broad range of difficulties
                    and have also volunteered as a counsellor with Home Start, a family support charity offering
                    practical and emotional assistance to parents who need support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Understanding that life can be hectic, I offer flexible scheduling for sessions, including weekly or
                    fortnightly options, as well as evening appointments to accommodate busy lifestyles subject to
                    availability.
